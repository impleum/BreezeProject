6	THE SOFTWARE

6.1	Notwithstanding clause 13, the Software is intended to operate as a Wallet to manage Bitcoin and IMPL Coins which you have the Private Keys to, and, in respect of Bitcoin, to interact with the MasterNode Service to allow transfers of Bitcoin between two Wallets in the Software.
6.2	Impleum does not provide the MasterNode Service.  The Software does not itself provide the MasterNode Service, but interacts with it.

7	THE MASTERNODE SERVICE

7.1	In respect of a Transfer using the Software, the Software searches for a list of Verified MasterNodes (ie. MasterNodes which meet the Requirements), and selects a Verified MasterNode to use in respect of the Transfer.
7.2	The operator of the relevant MasterNode provide the MasterNode Service in respect of the Transfer, in exchange for the MasterNode Fee.  Impleum does not provide the MasterNode Service, and does not operate any MasterNode.  The MasterNode Service shall be governed by arrangements between you and the operator of the relevant MasterNode.
7.3	Impleum does not know or have any record of the identity of the operators of the MasterNodes.

8	FEES

8.1	The Requirements include a criterion as to the MasterNode Fee.  This is the percent of the Transfer which the MasterNode will retain.
8.2	In respect of a Transfer, in addition to the MasterNode Fee, the transfer of the relevant Bitcoin to the MasterNode in the first case, will also attract a transaction fee (also known as a mining fee) in the normal manner for transfers of Bitcoin Units between two wallets.  This transaction fee is in addition to the MasterNode Fee, as it is collected by the mining operators before the MasterNode receives the relevant Bitcoin Units in respect of the Transfer.
8.3	By way of example only, if the criterion is for a MasterNode Fee of 1.55%, then a 100.0002 Bitcoin Unit Transfer may require a mining fee of 0.0002 Bitcoin Units, meaning the MasterNode would receive 100 Bitcoin Units.  The MasterNode is expected to return 98.45 Bitcoin Units to the relevant receiving Wallet, keeping 1.55 Bitcoin Units as the MasterNode Fee.  The mining fees which the MasterNode encounters in providing the MasterNode Service, and in sending the resultant Bitcoin Units to the relevant receiving Wallet are to be covered by the MasterNode from its MasterNode Fee, or otherwise.

9	REGIIMPLION AND IDENTITY

9.1	In order to use the Software, you must create a Wallet within the Software, or import the details relating to a compatible Wallet into the Software.
9.2	The Software requires the Private Key in relation to your Wallet(s) in order to function but does not require, store, or have the ability to store other personal information in relation to you or your identity.  There may be other information which is held by third parties which however may associate your Wallet(s) with your identity.
